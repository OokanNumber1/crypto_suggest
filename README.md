# crypto_suggest
The main use of this app is to provide basic information of crypto tokens rather than get lost in information provided on CoinMarketCap website.

This app uses data from CoinMarketCap API, I used Dart to do :
- sorting of top gainers and losers.
- sorting according to timeframes (1 day, 7 days and 30 days).
- adding of tokens as favourites by saving its id to the local storage of 
the device. 
- searching of tokens in the top 100 tokens (ranked by marketCap)
